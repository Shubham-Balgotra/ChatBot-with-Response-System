# ChatBot with Response System

This repository contains a versatile and interactive chatbot with a response system implemented in Python. The chatbot is designed to engage in conversations, provide responses, and handle various user inputs.

## Overview

The chatbot employs a text analysis and response selection mechanism to generate responses based on user input. It calculates the probability of predefined responses based on the presence of keywords and selects the response with the highest probability. The chatbot is built to respond to a wide range of inputs, including greetings, questions, and statements.

## Features

1. **Conversational AI:** Engage in dynamic conversations with the chatbot and receive contextually relevant responses.

2. **Predefined Responses:** The chatbot comes with a set of predefined responses for common user inputs, making it suitable for general-purpose interactions.

3. **Customizable Responses:** Customize and extend the chatbot's responses to tailor it to specific applications or domains.

4. **Exit Command:** Type "goodbye" to gracefully exit the chat and receive a farewell message.

5. **Minimal Dependencies:** The chatbot code is lightweight and has minimal external dependencies, making it easy to run and modify.
